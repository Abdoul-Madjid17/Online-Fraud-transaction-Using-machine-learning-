## Introduction

Online payment fraud is a significant concern in today's digital world. This project aims to develop a fraud detection system using machine learning algorithms. Three primary classification algorithms have been used: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest.

## Steps

The following steps are involved in the project. 

- Preprocess and explore the dataset.
- Train and evaluate the machine learning models.
- Visualize the results and model performance.

## Data

The project uses a dataset for online payment fraud detection. https://www.kaggle.com/ealaxi/paysim1/download
for the dataset. 

## Methods

Three classification algorithms are used in this project:

1. Logistic Regression
2. Decision Tree
3. Random Forest

Each algorithm's implementation and performance evaluation are present in the notebook.

## Results

The results of the project are available in the Notebooks file. You can analyze each classification algorithm's model performance, accuracy, and other relevant met.
